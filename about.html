                    About RTE ACT
                </h2>
                <p class="text-center">
                    Main Features of Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009 Free and compulsory education to all children of India in the 6 to 14 age group. No child shall be held back, expelled or required to pass a board examination until the completion of elementary education.
                    If a child above 6 years of age has not been admitted in any school or could not complete his or her elementary education, then he or she shall be admitted in a class appropriate to his or her age. However, if a case may be where a
                    child is directly admitted in the class appropriate to his or her age, then, in order to be at par with others, he or she shall have a right to receive special training within such time limits as may be prescribed. Provided further
                    that a child so admitted to elementary education shall be entitled to free education till the completion of elementary education even after 14 years. Proof of age for admission: For the purpose of admission to elementary education,
                    the age of a child shall be determined on the basis of the birth certificate issued in accordance with the Provisions of Birth. Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1856, or on the basis of such other document as may be prescribed.No
                    child shall be denied admission in a school for lack of age proof A child who completes elementary education shall be awarded a certificate. Call need to be taken for a fixed studentâ€“teacher ratio. Twenty-five per cent reservation
                    for economically disadvantaged communities in admission to Class I in all private schools is to be done. Improvement in the quality of education is important. School teachers will need adequate professional degree within five years
                    or else will lose job. School infrastructure (where there is a problem) need to be improved in every 3 years, else recognition will be cancelled. Financial burden will be shared between the state and the central government.
